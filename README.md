# LookSmart
Fork this if you want to look smart for your friends. Essentially lots of hello worlds.
<br>
The day has come. You can finnaly look smart in from of your friends. Just show them that multicolored bar tell them how you know **ALL** of those languages!!
<br>
That and using the terminal in front of them should do the trick. Run `curl https://www.google.com` and their jaws will drop.

*Note: Do this over a Zoom/Google Meet call, don't get sick!*
